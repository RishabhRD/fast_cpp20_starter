# fast_cpp20_starter

This project modifies [RishabhRD/cpp20_starter_project](https://github.com/RishabhRD/cpp20_starter_project).
It removes almost all the things just testing and conan are remaining. Most
of the times, this is what I want to have to start any C++ experimental
project. Then, I add the libraries as I need and conan is always there to
help me.
